<p><b class="bold">Team communication</b> was one of the first things we discussed. From the mini-project, this is one of the key <b class="bold">agile</b> principles that I found would make or break a project. Luckily we were all in the same classes almost every day, this allowed us to talk about what we have been working on and the progress we have made daily. Regular use of the <b class="bold">SCRUM</b> technique played a big part in our team’s communication. I believe only our group had a proper scrum during every class, and we made sure that it would get noticed by the lecturers, to strengthen our claim when writing this report. We would all stand up and discuss what we had done since the last scrum. We also updated each other on whether or not we needed help or needed to collaborate on something. <b class="bold">I think</b> having a scrum almost every day helped keep us on track, as no one wanted to show up empty handed, which I believe for the reason of not wanting let the team down. Although we have ways of collaborating through Gitlab, <b class="bold">face-to-face conversation</b> was the key in getting things done fast and efficiently. We would regularly <b class="bold">work together</b> during free time in our classes and in the common rooms. Nathan commented on our work ethic one day, he said he was really impressed with how we were collaborating together in one place and communicating face-to-face as that's what it will be like in a real work environment.</p>

<p>Our <b class="bold">team work</b> has improved a lot since the start of the project, and we have been able to <b class="bold">help each other</b> with our individual strengths, especially when in the same work environment. A good example of this is when I was working on setting up the modal grid in Javascript to display the sea-lion data. I essentially had the grid, elements and css set up for displaying the data but I was having trouble retrieving the data from Firebase. After giving it an honest attempt and with the no result, I reached out to Michael in person, who has been working with Firebase a lot in this project. I asked him if he could help me out as the current way of retrieving data was not working for this instance, and he was more than happy to help. A way I helped others is via peer programming, Michael was having issues with promises he was working on in JS, and it also had to do with the modal that I had worked on. So I was working with him to fix the problem, making suggestions on how else we can do it and we ended up finding a potential solution, so he then carried on working by himself to give that a go and it worked.<p>

<p>We decided that we would communicate through Slack for when we're not at Polytech, so that we can get in contact whatever time or place. We did this to clear up any doubts or share material, so that there isn't any time wasted on waiting for the next day to get something done. This helped us <b class="bold">manage our time</b> well and roll out <b class="bold">working software/features frequently</b>. Face-to-face communication is not always the ideal way to work, especially when not collaborating. It may speed up the process if you were in a comfortable and familiar environment, like your home. If you do come across something that is unfamiliar, we were able to get in contact through Slack. However, thinking back on it now, Slack may not have been the most ideal way to communicate outside of Polytech. A lot of the times we weren’t getting any notifications for new messages, causing a delay in our communication. Next time, I will likely find another way of communicating with the team, Discord perhaps, as it has notifications set up and also has the option for voice communication, I find that voice communication is an easier way to convey what you’re trying to say than over text.</p>

<p>I found that communicating with the team really helped me personally. I had been going through a really tough time this semester, having been in the hospital for almost 2 weeks during the holiday and also unable to work another week due to having my wisdom teeth taken out. I explained my situation early on so that they know why I have not contributed in those weeks and aren’t left surprised. They were very understanding throughout those few weeks. Michael especially was very <b class="bold">encouraging</b> I felt when we communicated, he understood my situation and let me know to ask him for any help I may need, which really kept me positive and <b class="bold">motivated</b> on not giving up on this project. Not talking about these things could have ended in a catastrophe for me in this class.</p>

<p>The next communication aspect we considered was how we would <b class="bold">communicate with the client</b>. We created an email with an appropriate name and contacted Jordana. We introduced ourselves and our intentions for this project. We were told that she had a very busy schedule by Martin. Seeing as how she was a volunteer, we took that into consideration when arranging the meeting. We were very polite and empathetic toward her situation. We asked her to give us some meeting times that would suit her schedule and let her know that we are willing to work around that. We wanted to handle this situation very professionally and I think we succeeded in doing that.</p>
<img src="{{ 'assets/images/introclient.png' | relative_url }}" alt="client-intro-email" style="width: 800px;"/>

<p> Client communication was our weakest point. In the beginning of the project, it took us almost a week to reply to her regarding our first meeting as our team could not decide on a time quick enough, due to our schedules and lack of communication. This lead to our first release being delayed, which goes against the very <b class="bold">first agile principle</b>. After the first meeting, we decided as a group to improve our own communication and client communication, if we wanted this project to succeed. From that week onward, we were in constant contact with Jordana and each other, which was some of the most productive weeks of our project as we were consistently communicating about the website and accepting <b class="bold">changing requirements</b> from Jordana. Our second meeting, we showcased our first draft of the website which had the adding sea lion feature. <b class="bold">Leadership</b> wise, I took charge of explaining the Agile process to Jordana, as we did not communicate with her previously about the agile process we were using and how she is a big part of it. Another <b class="bold">leadership</b> example is when I urged the team to come up with a meeting plan beforehand to avoid confusing the client, as we had a lot on the agenda for that meeting; showcasing first draft, design prototypes, explaining Agile, getting more user stories and planning our next sprint. So I wrote out an agenda with the help of the team, printed out a copy for everyone before the meeting took place.</p>

<p>Communication with the client started falling apart once again as we progressed through the project, we only had two meetings with the client throughout the eleven weeks which is very extreme and in the final weeks, communication was almost non-existent. Thinking back on it now, our communication began deteriorating when we didn’t complete our second sprint on time and we were too embarrassed to let her know. We did not know at the time that it was okay to continue our un-finished work in the next sprint. Now that we have a better understanding of Sprints, next time, if we explain the Agile process in the very beginning of the project to the client, I think client communication may last to the very end.<p>

<p>One thing I would say we did well for client communication is that we wrote out all the emails to the client as a team, we would bounce of ideas and ways of conveying things in a professional manner. I think we subconsciously did this to make the client feel comfortable in communicating with us. This is something I will definitely take on board for any future projects.</p>

<p>Personally, <b class="bold">time management</b> was really tough for me during this project, as I had fallen behind by almost 3 weeks. While doing work on the project I also had to catch up on all my classes. I did whatever I could to help improve this situation. I got in contact with my manager and got 3 weeks off work to give myself enough time to catch up, and it was going well, but then I got sick with the flu. My <b class="bold">patience, motivation and time management</b> was constantly being tested, it was just one thing after another. I felt that I needed to reach out to someone, Martin was very understanding for OOSD and he suggested that I speak to Joy. Speaking with Joy really put things into perspective and relieved me of some stress and improved my outlook on this course. She was willing to help in any way she could. Once I got her a medical certificate, she got in contact with all my lecturers and explained my situation to them. Just knowing that the lecturers understood my situation was a big boost of <b class="bold">motivation</b> for me as I then decided that I was just going to do my best with what little time I have left and get through this semester.</p>

<p>Having gone through all this, I feel that I will be able to empathize with another team member that may be going through something similar in my future projects.</p>

<p>I felt that as a team, our <b class="bold">time management</b> was lacking. We also did not have a solid <b class="bold">leadership</b> in the early stages of the project. We had all worked on gathering information and data and designing the database model <b class="bold">together</b> up until week 4. For the next 1-2 weeks only half of the team was doing any work and the other half including myself were waiting as our work being done relied on their work. I was specifically assigned to work with CSS in the beginning, however I could not implement anything until Week 6 of the project as I had nothing to work with. This is something that I will need to <b class="bold">consider</b> in the <b class="bold">next project</b>, sharing the workload evenly and have everyone working on something from start to finish. During the down time, George and I were figuring out what CSS framework we should learn. We did a bit of research and got back to the team. George suggested that we use Bootstrap as he already knew how to use it, and I suggested that we go with Foundation so that we can learn a new framework to use for our technical proficiency and followed up with some points to convince them. George and I decided to meet up and begin working on our first CSS release. I went in to meet up with him but he was unable to make it, but knowing that I have not contributed for the last 2 weeks gave me a bit of <b class="bold">motivation</b> to get something done, even if I had to do this part alone. So I went home and began implementing Foundation into the add a sea lion page that was just put up by Michael and pushed the first CSS release that night.</p>
<img src="{{ 'assets/images/firstgit.png' | relative_url }}" alt="first css release" style="margin: 0 16px 0 0;"/>
<p>From that week onwards, I consistently contributed to the project and always looked for something to work on, as you can probably tell from the timeline. I have provided screenshots of my gitlab activity.</p>

<p>My ability to work in a team has drastically improved having worked on this project. Mainly because I learned how to collaborate with others on Gitlab. Until now, I had no clue how to use gitlab with other people. I'm glad I was able to be a part of this group and I'd like to mention Michael's leadership in this, as he taught me how to create and use branches.</p>
