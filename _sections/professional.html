<p style="text-align: justify;">Team communication was one of the first things we discussed as team. From the mini-project, this is one of the key agile principles that I found 
would make or break a project. We were all in the same classes almost every day, and we catch each other up on what we have been working on and what progress we have made.
Regular use of SCRUM played a big part in team communication. I believe only our group had an official scrum during every class, we made sure that it would get noticed
by the lecturers as we would all stand up and discuss what he had done since the last scrum, and what we plan on doing next. We also updated each other on whether or not
we needed help or needed to collaborate on something. I think having a scrum almost every day helped keep us on track, as no one wanted to show up empty handed, and I believe for the
reason of not wanting let the rest of the team down. Although we have ways of collaborating through gitlab, face-to-face conversation was the key in getting things
done fast and efficiently. We would regularly work together during free time in any of our classes and in the common rooms. Nathan commented on our work ethic one day,
he said he was really impressed with how we were collaborating together in one place and communicating face-to-face as that's what it will be like in a real work environment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To make sure we weren't going off on a tanjent in our workflow, we decided that we would communicate through Slack for when we're not at Polytech,
so that we can communicate whatever time or place. We did this to clear up any doubts or share material, so that there isn't any time wasted on waiting for the next
day to get something done. This helped us manage our time well and roll out working software/features frequently.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The next communication aspect we considered was how we would communicate with the client. So we created 
an email with an appropriate name and contacted our client. We introduced ourselves and our intentions for this project. We asked to arrange a meeting with Jordana. We were told that 
she had a very busy schedule by Martin. We took that into consideration when contacting her. We were very polite in our email and empathetic toward her situation.
We asked her to give us some meeting times that would suit her schedule and let her know that we are willing to work around that.

----we did not want to waste her time as she was a volunteer</p>
