<p><b class="bold">Team communication</b> was one of the first things we discussed. From the mini-project, this is one of the key <b class="bold">agile</b> principles that I found would make or break a project. We were all in the same classes almost every day, and we would talk about what we have been working on and the progress we have made daily. Regular use of the <b class="bold">SCRUM</b> technique played a big part in our team’s communication. I believe only our group had a proper scrum during every class, we made sure that it would get noticed by the lecturers, to strengthen our claim on scrums when writing this report. We would all stand up and discuss what he had done since the last scrum. We also updated each other on whether or not we needed help or needed to collaborate on something. <b class="bold">I think</b> having a scrum almost every day helped keep us on track, as no one wanted to show up empty handed, I believe for the reason of not wanting let the team down. Although we have ways of collaborating through Gitlab, <b class="bold">face-to-face conversation</b> was the key in getting things done fast and efficiently. We would regularly <b class="bold">work together</b> during free time in our classes and in the common rooms. Nathan commented on our work ethic one day, he said he was really impressed with how we were collaborating together in one place and communicating face-to-face as that's what it will be like in a real work environment. Our <b class="bold">team work</b> has improved a lot since the start of the project, and we have been able to <b class="bold">help each other</b> with our individual strengths, especially when in the same work environment.</p>

<p>We decided that we would communicate through Slack for when we're not at Polytech, so that we can get in contact whatever time or place. We did this to clear up any doubts or share material, so that there isn't any time wasted on waiting for the next day to get something done. This helped us manage our time well and roll out working software/features frequently. Face-to-face communication is not always the ideal or efficient way to work, especially when not collaborating, it may speed up the process if you were in a comfortable and familiar environment, like your home. If you do come across something that is unfamiliar, we were able to get in contact through Slack. Thinking back on it now, Slack may not have been the ideal way to communicate outside Polytech, a lot of the times what happened was we weren’t getting any notifications for new messages, which delayed our communication somewhat. I would most likely find another way of communicating with the team next time, Discord perhaps, as there is voice chat in there as well.</p>

<p>The next communication aspect we considered was how we would communicate with the client. We created an email with an appropriate name and contacted Jordana. We introduced ourselves and our intentions for this project. We were told that she had a very busy schedule by Martin. Seeing as how she was a volunteer, we took that into consideration when arranging the meeting. We were very polite and empathetic toward her situation. We asked her to give us some meeting times that would suit her schedule and let her know that we are willing to work around that. We wanted to handle this situation very professionally and I think we succeeded in doing that.</p>

<p> Client communication was our weak point in this project overall. In the beginning of the project, it took us almost a week to reply to her regarding our first meeting as our team could not decide on a time quick enough, due to our schedules. This delayed the project by a week leading our first release to be delayed, which goes against the very first agile principle. After the first meeting, we decided as a group to improve our own communication and client communication, if we wanted this project to succeed. From that week onward, we were in constant contact with Jordana and each other, which was </p>
