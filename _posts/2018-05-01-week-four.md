Once again, I was unable to contribute to the project during this week as I had 4 wisdom teeth taken out and was unable to work on anything. Although I wasn't fully recoverd, I still showed up to the second session that week so that I don't fall behind too much to the point where I don't know what's happening.

The database was set up in Firebase and a very basic UI was created for inserting data. We contacted her on Friday to set up a meeting. We wanted to explain to her the agile process we're using to plan our work load as she plays a big part in this process. We also included a link to the current web app for her to have a look through.
