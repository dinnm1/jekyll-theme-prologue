This week in class we came up with some user stories using the notes from the meeting we had last week. We also designed the database model, we had to go through a few different possible designs to get something that was somewhat accurate.

Include picture proof here and brief summary...

Once we had done enough research on what platform to use for the database and suggestions from Martin. We came to conclusion of using Firebase to create and host the database.
