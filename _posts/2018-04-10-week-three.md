This week in class we came up with some user stories using the notes from the meeting we had last week. We decided to use Firebase to create and host the database. With that in mind, we designed the database model. We had to go through a few different designs to get something that was somewhat accurate. We contacted the client to update them on what's been going on. We showed her the database model we had come up with, and our plans for the upcoming weeks.
