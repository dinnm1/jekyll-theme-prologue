The teams and projects were announced today. Connor, George, Isabel, Michael and myself were assigned to the Sea Lions database team. Since we've all been in the same classes from the beginning of the course we all knew each other, so there wasn't much time needed to acquaint ourselves with one another. Once the team got together, we began discussing and brainstorming potential platform ideas for the database. However, we still didn't have much of a clue on what the project entailed. While we were waiting to speak to Martin, we thought out some questions to ask him, to understand the essence of the project and requirements.

Once we had a solid understanding of the project, we contacted our client Jordana. Through email, we briefly introduced ourselves and our intentions for this project and what we wanted to do for the NZSLT. We then asked to arrange a meeting with her to get a grasp of their current record keeping system and ways that it can be improved.

We were very polite in our email and empathetic toward her situation as she is very busy and had a tight schedule according to Martin. So we asked her to give us some meeting times that would suit her schedule and let her know that we are willing to work around that.
