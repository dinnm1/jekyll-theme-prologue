I was allocated to the Sea Lions Database project, along with Connor, George, Isabel, Michael. It didn't take long to acquaint ourselves as we all knew each other. We decided to communicate through Slack and to use Gitlab for collaborating and ticketing. Our main focus this week was to get a firm understanding of this project and requirements. We had a chat with Martin as he was the one who brought in this project. At the same time, we were brainstorming what platform we could use, looking at the pros and cons. Introduced ourselves to our client via email and made plans to have our first meeting.
