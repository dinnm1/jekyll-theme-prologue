This week, I created a search page and implemented the CSS so that we can integrate the search functionality once it has been compelted by Isabel. Connor, George and I were experimenting with some CSS and navigation options. Connor was experimenting with Foundation to find a nice way to display the sea lion data. Later that week I implemented minimalistic navigation building block available on the Foundation website and added the Search and Add pages, while having a placeholder for the Display All page as it was still being worked on.
