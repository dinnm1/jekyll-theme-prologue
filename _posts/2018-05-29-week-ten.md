The teams and projects were announced today.

Connor, George, Isabel, Michael and myself were assigned to the Sea Lions database team. Once the team got together, we began discussing potential platform ideas for the database.
While we were waiting to speak to Martin, we thought out some questions to ask him, to understand the essence of the project and requirements.
