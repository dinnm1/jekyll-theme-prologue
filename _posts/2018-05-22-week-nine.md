This week, George and I were supposed to meet up to work on setting up the current web app with the CSS framework. Unfortunately, he was busy with another class. While the team was working on the filtering, I began working on the CSS so that it doesn't get delayed any longer. Created a branch from the development branch and began implementing the CSS into the web app. Git pushed fully styled form using the Foundation framework. Later that week, implemented a grid design for the table layout so that each sealion's card isn't a page long as there is a lot of data to display.
