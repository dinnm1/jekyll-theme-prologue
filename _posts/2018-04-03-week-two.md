Jordana replied to our email promtly, but we were seriously slacking in communicating with the client in the first week. We replied almost 5 days late as we couldn't decide which time suited us best, by which time it was too last minute to meet mid this week. So the meeting had to be pushed to the Friday.
Sadly, due to that fact we were unable to get anything done for most of this week.

We booked a room for that day and let her know where we were meeting.

This is where our first Sprint began as a team, I will outline what we did during this sprint as we progress through the timeline.
Before the meeting took place, we came up with a meeting plan and thought up some questions that we could ask:

<ul>
  <li>Ask her to explain their current system.</li>
  <li>What changes/functionality would they like added to the database.</li>
  <li>What data are you collecting? (complications/relationships).</li>
  <li>What do they do with the data after it is collected?</li>
  <li>How many users?</li>
  <li>What does the user do? (use cases) (different users â€“ use cases).</li>
  <li>Is having a really simplistic UI a priority? Or is flexibility for data entry more important?</li>
  <li>Would they at all consider paying a small amount for the system storage e.g. cloud hosting is probably free but could have low monthly cost depending on how much resource is required/if system grows - just to see if this is worth looking into.</li>
  <li>Ask for access to their current system/excel sheet</li>
</ul>

Friday -
We met with the client and got the information we needed and had a pretty good understanding of what we needed to make.
Jordana was very detailed and thorough with the explanation and answers to our questions, which played a huge part in our understanding of the requirements.

What we found out:
<ul>
  <li>Process of tagging sealions and why conservation efforts are required</li>
  <li>Saw physical copies of their current record keeping system in the form of multiple different spreadsheets.</li>
  <li>Database use cases</li>
  <li>Data that we can expect to have in the database</li>
</ul>
