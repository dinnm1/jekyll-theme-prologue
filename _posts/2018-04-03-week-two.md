Early this week was very uneventful. We had a platform suggestion from Martin known as Firebase which was a very good option for the needs of this project. We had our first meeting with the client on Friday to get ourselves up to date with their current record keeping system and how it can be improved. Received physical and digital copies of their system so that we can begin designing our database model.
