Early this week, I spent a lot of time cleaning up everything on the web app. Also cleaned up the css files. Added CSS to the admin page. On Friday I was at polytech from 10am till 10:30pm working on the project along with Michael and Isabel so that we can wrap this project up before next week. I worked on the CSS as usual and worked with Mike and Isabel to add things as needed and work with their javascript and also add my own. I created a replica of our checkbox design but in a label form to display what toes have been clipped. Re-arranged the buttons on the update modal and changed a lot of CSS to make it flow with the changing components. Changed javascript for adding a new feature to append to the top of the 4th column div instead of the bottom so that it is more obvious to the user. Added numbers to the clipped toes checkboxes in the update modal. Included js file in Search page to get the update modal going.
